The work being submitted is my own individual work - 2018-03-31

I used several libraries from the Algorithms 4th Edition textbook by Sedgewick as templates for my implementation and
modified them as necessary. I included the loading and reading of data in the constructors for the generation files
for consistency across modules, simplicity and readability.
